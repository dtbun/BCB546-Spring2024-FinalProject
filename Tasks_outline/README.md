# Outline for the project

* Read the article and take notes on what is happening (these notes can be put together for the article description and what we need to do)
* Break down the Methods into tasks on processing data, data analysis, figure generation, and extra figures we think might be good to have.

# Data
* The phenotype including age at diagnosis, gender, and smoking history are also available from the public website (http://genome.cshlp.org/content/22/11/2109/suppl/
DC1).
* The transcriptome sequencing data from 68 lung adenocarcinoma patients with validated smoking status were downloaded from Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) with accession number GSE40419.
* For validation of genes identified in nonsmoker group, independent RNA-seq data from six nonsmoker patients were downloaded from GEO with accession number GSE37765 [12].

# Methods tasks
* Figure 1 and Figure 2 are the figures we can complete. Volcano plot, heat map, etc
